Hello there! Thank you for taking the time to look at our project <3.

Please, follow the directions outlined below, which will allow you to recreate our analysis!
––––––––-–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Step 1: Download the data from OWID's data explorer (https://docs.owid.io/projects/etl/api/covid/#download-data). 
*Note: this download occurs directly in the script, so you may ignore Step 1 if you so choose.

Step 2: Data Preprocessing + Analysis
-Open the qBIO_stats_challenge_athaliana_upload.Rmd in RStudio (or VSCODE)

-Run the chunks sequentially, beginning with the first chunk of the RMarkdown doc.

-Continue running cells to eventually produce plots, which are described within the RMarkdown file. 


That's it!

Known Bugs: None at the moment.
